problem : how to filter the internet so that I only get what I want and no crap.

The problem with the internet is its size, Its soooo big. How do you find those things that I will like and exclude the crap?

Possible ideas:

use previous browsing history to anticipate what I will like.  

sources of what I like 
- twiter
- Face Book
- Google plus
- browser history

What do I like? how do I find out what I like. 

the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour.
